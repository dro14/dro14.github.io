          This project was made as the final project for the Computer
          Programming course. It was a rewarding experience of applying what was
          learned in Linear Algebra and create something of practical use.
          During the implementation, I practiced the OOP paradigm and learned
          how to work with matrices in code.

        <p>
          After extensive experimentation, I am glad to present my
          implementation of the fastest comparison-based sorting algorithm -
          merge sort. This implementation has been written in Go and is
          optimized for speed, delivering outstanding performance in comparison
          to other implementations. I invite fellow programmers to put my
          implementation to the test by attempting to beat my record using a
          language of their choice. For more information on the project,
          including code and documentation, please visit the repository's
          description. Join me in the exciting challenge of optimizing sorting
          algorithms and let's see who comes out on top!

          I'm glad to announce that I've made a Telegram bot for ChatGPT, with
          the aim of making AI technologies accessible to everyone!<br />
          As a large language model trained by OpenAI, ChatGPT can answer a wide
          range of questions and engage in meaningful conversations. With this
          bot, you can chat with ChatGPT directly on Telegram and receive quick,
          accurate responses to your queries.<br />
          Whether you're seeking information on a specific topic, looking for
          advice, or just wanting to chat with a friendly AI, ChatGPT is here to
          help. My goal in creating this bot is to bring the power of AI to a
          wider audience and to make it easy and fun for anyone to explore the
          possibilities of this exciting technology.<br />
          Creating this bot was a labor of love, and I'm excited to share it
          with you all. If you're on Telegram, I invite you to give it a try and
          see for yourself how powerful and engaging ChatGPT can be. Thank you
          for your support, and let's keep pushing the boundaries of what AI can
          do!<br /><br />
          P.S. To help you appreciate how powerful this technology is, I want to
          mention that the text above was created by ChatGPT itself.<br /><br />
          Have a nice chat! : )
